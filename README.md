# KiwiIRC -  Plugin

This is a basic plugin template for Kiwi IRC. 

Just create a plugins folder in /static if you don't already have one.
Then download this plugin into that directory.
Finally, edit your config.json file like so:

    "plugins": [
      {"name": "plugintemplate", "url": "./static/plugins/plugin-template/plugin.js"}
    ]
